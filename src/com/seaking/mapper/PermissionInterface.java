/**
 * A permission that belongs to the set of known permissions.
 * 
 * The idea of having two interfaces PermissionInterface and
 * PermissionRequestInterface stems from the fact that sometimes a permission as
 * it is requested in the manifest is not known to SAAF.
 * 
 * At a given time SAAF has a set known Permissions. These are modeled using the
 * PermissionInterface. Over the course of a SAAF deployment the set of known
 * permissions may change for a number of reasons:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Some permissions where forgotten in the inital config</li>
 * <li>The android platform changes. Google adds new permissions</li>
 * <li>New frameworks using custom permissions appear</li>
 * <li>...</li>
 * </ul>
