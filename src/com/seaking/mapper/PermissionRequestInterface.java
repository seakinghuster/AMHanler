/**
 * A permission as it is requested by the Manifest.
 * 
 * The fact that there are two intefaces PermissionInterface
 * and PermissionRequestInterface stems from the fact that
 * sometimes a permission as it is requested int he manifest
 * is not known to SAAF.
 * 
 * At a given time SAAF has a set known Permissions.
 * These are modeled using the PermissionInterface.
 * Over the course of a SAAF deployment the set of
 * known permissions may change for a number of reasons:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Some permissions where forgotten in the inital config</li>
 *  <li>The android platform changes. Google adds new permissions</li>
 *  <li>New frameworks using custom permissions appear</li>
 *  <li>...</li>
 * </ul>
